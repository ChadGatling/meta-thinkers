				Tenley has that special spark with kids that makes it easy for them to connect and then in turn want to build relationship and grow. The MT enrichments have that same spark of love and creativity in them that draws children in, lets them take charge of their learning, and leads them to build and challenge themselves. Its a very unique program thats fills a need for parents who want something different." -MT Community Classroom Parent

			<Testimonial>
				Meta Thinkers provides youth with exciting and engaging learning activities.  Thinkers are given the chance to experience their own unique creativity and to show that creativity to their community.  This is excellent for the self-esteem of children!  It is so important for every child to experience rich, engaging and creative experiences like what is offered through Meta Thinkers. This is what is missing in schools!" - MT Artisan
